go version

<!-- 4. Clone the CARV Source Code. Clone the CARV Verifier repository and build the source code: -->

git clone https://github.com/carv-protocol/verifier.git && cd verifier && make build

<!-- 5. Navigate to the Bin Folder. Change into the `bin` folder where the keystone generator and files to start the CARV node application: -->

cd bin

<!-- 6. Create a Screen Session. Create a screen session called CARV: -->

screen -S carv

<!-- 7. Generate a random burner wallet. Go to the https://chaintool.tech/generateWallet/evmWallet and generate a random wallet by clicking
 on create. You can either copy the address, mnemonic and pri-key to a text editor or export the generated wallet by clicking on download

8. Delegate Your Node
Go to the [CARV Alphanet Explorer](https://alphanet-explorer.carv.io/verifiers),
connect your wallet, and delegate your node to the generated wallet address.

9. Start the Verifier Node.Start the verifier node using the following command: -->

./verifier -private-key <Your Private Key> -reward-address <Your Reward Address> -commission-rate <Your Commission Rate>

	<!-- Replace the placeholders with your specific details:

	- <Path to keystore file>: The file path generated during the keystore creation.
	
	- <keystore password>: The password you used for the keystore.
	
	- <Your Reward Address>: The wallet address for your commission rewards.
	
	- <Your Commission Rate>: Your commission rate (0–100). 
This rate determines the percentage of CARV rewards you want to receive from those who delegate their node to you.
 The commission rate can be set between 0 and 100, where 0 means you don’t take any commission from delegators,
 and 100 means you take all the rewards.
	
Important: remove the first 0x from your private key, for example if your generated private key is
 0x4190ae49dcb5ca5dd4eda9db6f4ab6d7b73ec790afb921c64bfba026895e9e69,
 just put in 4190ae49dcb5ca5dd4eda9db6f4ab6d7b73ec790afb921c64bfba026895e9e69 in the section private key -->

 <!-- Example of how the command should look like -->

 ./verifier -private-key 4190ae49dcb5ca5dd4eda9db6f4ab6d7b73ec790afb921c64bfba026895e9e69 -reward-address eb4d75edb0dca607c9bb0a1388f1f0461f0ba045 -commission-rate 5

 <!-- If you get the error below with GaslessService failed Sytem is busy due to high volume,
 just reenter the command several times till it goes through -->

 <!-- 10. Manage the Screen Session. To minimize the screen running your verifier node: Press `Ctrl + A`, then `D`. 
 To re-enter the screen session: -->

 screen -r carv

 <!-- Congratulations, you have successfully installed your CARV Verifier Node! -->
